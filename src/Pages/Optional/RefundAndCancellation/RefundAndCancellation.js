            <h5 className="py-2">Airlines schedule changes/flight cancellations</h5>
            <p>
              All Airlines have differing rules and policies regarding schedule
              changes, which are beyond our control.Due to the operational needs
              of each airline, changes are often made to the flights that they
              are currently operating.Often these changes are a prediction of
              travel needs for a future dates but can also reflect same day
              changes. Types of changes could be: flight number changes, time
              changes, routing, date changes and or cancellations. Cancellations
              include when an airline has stopped or temporarily canceled
              service to certain cities, or stopped service on certain daysof
              the week.
            </p>
            <h5 className="py-2">Refund payment</h5>
            <p>
              Refund will only be reversed to the cardholder's account that has
              been used for transaction. In case of cash refund, gateway charge
              or processing will be deducted
            </p>
            <p>
              Triplover will process refund requests to gateway providers or to
              the card issuing bank only after receiving refund payment from
              airlines.
            </p>
            <h5 className="py-2">
              Reasons for cancellations or schedule changes may include

              flights, flights that are missed, or flights not connecting due to
              any scheduled changes made by the airlines.

            <h5 className="py-2">Our policy on schedule changes</h5>
            <p>
              We make every attempt to notify the customer of any schedule
              changes. It is always best to contact the airline to reconfirm you
              flights within 72 hours of departure.
