                When you submit your credit or debit card for a purchase, we
                request an authorization for the amount of your anticipated
                transaction (placing a temporary "hold" on the funds). If for
                some reason we are unable to confirm your booking,you will not
                be charged and we will request that such hold be released by
                your credit or debit card bank;until then, funds subject to the

                There can be many reasons why your credit or debit card may not
                have been approved or charged. Examples of these maybe: airline
                could not confirm the booking, fare increased since payment
                information was submitted and prior to ticketing; or sufficient
                funds not available on the credit card. In such instances where
                the fare are may have increased, you will be provided with
                alternate options and you have the right to cancel the booking
                at no cost to you. When the booking is ticketed at the cost
                originally quoted to you the ticket becomes non-refundable and

              Airlines schedule changes/flight cancellations
            </h5>
            <p>
              All Airlines have differing rules and policies regarding schedule
              changes, which are beyond our control.Due to the operational needs
              of each airline, changes are often made to the flights that they
              are currently operating.Often these changes are a prediction of
              travel needs for a future dates but can also reflect same day
              changes. Types of changes could be: flight number changes, time
              changes, routing, date changes and or cancellations. Cancellations
              include when an airline has stopped or temporarily canceled
              service to certain cities, or stopped service on certain daysof
              the week.
            </p>
            <h5 className="text-primary py-2">Refund payment</h5>
            <p>
              Refund will only be reversed to the cardholder's account that has
              been used for transaction. In case of cash refund, gateway charge
              or processing will be deducted
            </p>
            <p>
              Triplover will process refund requests to gateway providers or to
              the card issuing bank only after receiving refund payment from
              airlines.
            </p>
            <h5 className="text-primary py-2">
              Reasons for cancellations or schedule changes may include
            </h5>
            <ul style={{
                listStyleType: "disc",

              Triplover does not assume any liability whatsoever for cancelled
              flights, flights that are missed, or flights not connecting due to
              any scheduled changes made by the airlines.
            </p>
            <h5 className="text-primary py-2">Our policy on schedule changes</h5>
            <p>
              We make every attempt to notify the customer of any schedule
              changes. It is always best to contact the airline to reconfirm you
              flights within 72 hours of departure.
            </p>
            <h5 className="text-primary py-2">Customers obligations</h5>
            <p>
              It is always important for the customer to reconfirm their flights
              with the airlines 24 to 72 hours prior to departure, especially if
              they are already traveling.You should periodically check emails
              for updates regarding flight schedules and respond in a timely
              manner.
            </p>
            <h5 className="text-primary py-2">Ticket delivery</h5>
            <p>
              Most tickets are electronic (e-Tickets), however with certain
              itineraries where an e-Ticket is not available a paper ticket will
              be issued. If an e-Ticket could not be issued for a particular
              reservation or if a delivery was being made of another product or
              service, Triplover will send the paper ticket, product or service
              through a secure mode of delivery .If an e-Ticket is generated the
              ticket information will be available on the Site.

            <p>
              Please note that your seats, meals, frequent flyer and other
              special requests are requests only.The airline reserves the right
              to apply any revisions to the requested seat allocation without
              notification.All requests should be erified with the airline. We
              do not guarantee you will be assignedthe seat you have requested.
              We also do not guarantee that your meal, frequent flyer and other
              special requests will be confirmed by the airline. It is therefore
              recommended you contact your airline directly to confirm these
              requests.

              Travel Services Terms and Conditions

            <p>
              Reservations, bookings, and purchases
              <br />
              You agree to abide by the terms and conditions of purchase imposed
              by any supplier with whom you elect to deal. A supplier that is an
              air carrier is required to make available to the public the terms
              of its contract of carriage, and we make available the fare rules
              for all air carrier tickets before purchase.
            </p>
            <p>
              The circumvention of an air carrier's rules, including practices
              such as back-to-back ticketing (purchasing two or more tickets
              with overlapping travel dates in order to circumvent minimum stay
              requirements) and hidden-city ticketing (purchasing tickets
              including segments which the purchaser does not intend to use in
              order to circumvent an air carrier's pricing structure), is
              prohibited by many air carriers. The use of prohibited ticketing
              practices may result in the air carrier taking actions including
              the cancellation of the ticket, denied boarding, revocation of
              frequent flier miles and other benefits, additional charges to the
              purchaser's credit card, additional charges collected at the
              airport, or future invoicing.
            </p>
            <p>
              You are responsible for ensuring that your purchases abide by the
              terms and conditions of purchase imposed by any supplier with whom
              you elect to deal, including terms and conditions of purchase set
              forth in an air carrier's fare rules or contract of carriage.
